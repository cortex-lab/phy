        The View instance contains a special `canvas` object which is a `Ì€PlotCanvas` instance.
        This class derives from `BaseCanvas` which itself derives from the PyQt5 `QOpenGLWindow`.
        The canvas represents a rectangular black window where you can draw geometric objects
        with OpenGL.

        phy uses the notion of **Layout** that lets you organize graphical elements in different
        subplots. These subplots can be organized in several ways:

        * Grid layout: a `(n_rows, n_cols)` grid of subplots (example: FeatureView).
        * Boxed layout: boxes arbitrarily located (example: WaveformView, using the
          probe geometry)
        * Stacked layout: one column with `n_boxes` subplots (example: TraceView,
          one row per channel)

        In this example, we use the stacked layout, with one subplot per cluster. This number
        will change at each cluster selection, depending on the number of selected clusters.
        But initially, we just use 1 subplot.

        self.canvas.set_layout('stacked', n_plots=1)

        self.templates = templates

        """
        phy uses the notion of **Visual**. This is a graphical element that is represented with
        a single type of graphical element. phy provides many visuals:

        * PlotVisual (plots)
        * ScatterVisual (points with a given marker type and different colors and sizes)
        * LineVisual (for lines segments)
        * HistogramVisual
        * PolygonVisual
        * TextVisual
        * ImageVisual

        Each visual comes with a single OpenGL program, which is defined by a vertex shader
        and a fragment shader. These are programs written in a C-like language called GLSL.
        A visual also comes with a primitive type, which can be points, line segments, or
        triangles. This is all a GPU is able to render, but the position and the color of
        these primitives can be entirely customized in the shaders.

        The vertex shader acts on data arrays represented as NumPy arrays.

        These low-level details are hidden by the visuals abstraction, so it is unlikely that
        you'll ever need to write your own visual.

        In ManualClusteringViews, you typically define one or several visuals. For example
        if you need to add text, you would add `self.text_visual = TextVisual()`.

        by clusters selected in the similarity view.

        """
        For performance reasons, it is best to use as few visuals as possible. In this example,
        we want 1 waveform template per subplot. We will use a single visual covering all
        subplots at once. This is the key to achieve good performance with OpenGL in Python.
        However, this comes with the drawback that the programming interface is more complicated.

        In principle, we would have to concatenate all data (x and y coordinates) of all subplots
        to pass it to `self.visual.set_data()` in order to draw all subplots at once. But this
        is tedious.

        phy uses the notion of **batch**: for each subplot, we set *partial data* for the subplot
        which just prepares the data for concatenation *after* we're done with looping through
        all clusters. The concatenation happens in the special call
        `self.canvas.update_visual(self.visual)`.

        We need to call `visual.reset_batch()` before constructing a batch.

            channels for the cluster. The channels are sorted by decreasing template amplitude,
            so the first one is the peak channel. The channel ids can be found in

            phy requires you to specify explicitly the x and y range of the plots.

            lower-left and upper-right corners of a rectangle. By default, the data bounds
            of the entire view is (-1, -1, 1, 1), also called normalized device coordinates.
            Eventually, OpenGL uses this coordinate system for display, but phy provides
            a transform system to convert from different coordinate systems, both on the CPU
            and the GPU.
