# Release notes

Current version is phy v2.0b1 (beta 1) (7 Feb 2020).


## New views

* **Cluster scatter view**: a scatter plot of all clusters, on two user-defined dimensions (for example, depth vs firing rate). The marker size and colors can also depend on two additional user-defined dimensions.

* **Raster view**: spike trains of all clusters

* **Template view**: template waveforms of all clusters

* **Cluster statistics views** (histograms):
    * ISI
    * Instantaneous firing rate
    * Write your own as a plugin

* **Spike attributes views**: a scatter view is automatically created for every `spike_somename.npy` containing 1D or 2D values per spike

* **Trace image view**: a minimal trace view that shows a large textured image `(n_channels, n_samples)` instead of multiple polylines.

* Improved **Amplitude view**: different types of spike amplitudes as a function of time, with histograms.

* **IPython view**: interact with the GUI and the data programmatically.

## New features

* **Split clusters in the amplitude view or in the template feature view**, in addition to the feature view
* **Cluster view**:
    * Dynamically **filter** the list of clusters based on cluster metrics and labels (using JavaScript syntax)
    * Snippets to quickly **sort and filter** clusters
    * New default columns: mean firing rate, and template waveform amplitude
    * The styling can be customized with CSS in a plugin (see plugin examples in the documentation)
* **Amplitude view**:
    * Show an histogram of amplitudes overlaid with the amplitudes
    * Support for multiple types of amplitudes (template waveform amplitude, raw waveform amplitude, feature amplitude)
    * Splitting is supported
    * Alt+click in the amplitude view to center the trace view to a certain time (position shown with the vertical yellow bar)
    * Show the time interval currently displayed in the trace view as a vertical yellow bar
* **Correlogram view**:
    * Horizontal line for the baseline firing rate
    * Customizable vertical line for the refractory period
* **Waveform view**:
    * Change the number of waveforms directly from the GUI
    * Higher-quality thicker mean and template waveforms
* **Feature view**:
    * One can now change the specification of the subplots in a plugin
* **All views**:
    * Add multiple views of the same type
    * Closable views
    * View menu
    * Toggle automatic update of views upon cluster selection
    * Easily take screenshots of individual views
    * Control bar at the top of every view, with customizable text and buttons (screenshot, toggle auto update, etc.)
    * Axes (in most views)
    * Higher-quality text with OpenGL
    * Control+wheel to change the scaling (in most views)
    * Alt+wheel to change the marker size
    * Change the number of "best" channels in the user configuration file
* **Trace view**:
    * Auto-update by default
* **Trace view, raster view, template view**:
    * Customizable color mapping for clusters based on any cluster metrics or labels
* **Probe view**:
    * Channel labels
* **Template model**
    * Support **multiple raw data files** (virtually concatenated)
    * Support for **multiple channel shanks**: add a `channel_shanks.npy` file with shape `(n_channels,` ), with the shank integer index of every channel.


## Improvements

* A new file `cluster_info.tsv` is automatically saved, containing all information from the cluster view.
* Minimal high-level data access API in the Template Model
* Improved performance, avoid blocking the GUI when loading large amounts of data
* Fix scaling issues in waveform view
* More efficient probe view
* Slightly different gray colors for noise and MUA clusters in the cluster view
* Menu reorganization
* Toolbar with icons
* Bug fixes with cluster labels
* New `plugins/` folder in the repository, with many plugin examples
* Documentation rewritten from scratch, with many examples


## Internal changes

* Support **Python 3.7+**, dropped Python 2.x support (reached End Of Life)
* Updated to **PyQt5** from PyQt4, which is now unsupported
* Improved OpenGL-based plotting API (based on a fork of glumpy instead of vispy)
* Dropped the phy-contrib repository
* Created **phylib**, a small dependency with I/O code and non-graphical utilities, also used by ibllib
* Moved the phy GitHub repository from kwikteam to cortex-lab organization


## Notes for plugin maintainers

The following changes may affect phy plugins:

* The `add_view` and `view_actions_created` events have been removed.
* You should now use the new event `view_attached(view, gui)` that is emitted when a view is attached to the GUI.


## [coming soon] Upcoming features

* Support for events: PSTH view, trial-based raster plots, etc.
* More efficient GPU-based plotting
