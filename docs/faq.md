# Frequently Asked Questions

Read this section to understand what phy is and is not.

## What file formats does phy support?

None, but [phycontrib](https://github.com/kwikteam/phy-contrib) contains a set of plugins supporting file formats like the Kwik format.

If a file format becomes a widely-used standard in the future, we might support it directly in phy.

## Are there ready-to-use scripts and GUIs for spike sorting in phy?

No, but there are some in [phycontrib](https://github.com/kwikteam/phy-contrib).

## Can you add feature X?

No.

In principle, you should be able to implement it by writing a plugin, and if not, we'd be happy to help.

If the majority of our users are desperately asking one particular feature, we might consider implementing it.

Here is a nice explanation of why *No* should be the default answer here (from the *Getting Real* book by 37signals):

> **Each time you say yes to a feature, you're adopting a child**. You have to take your baby through a whole chain of events (e.g. design, implementation, testing, etc.). And once that feature's out there, you're stuck with it. Just try to take a released feature away from customers and see how pissed off they get.

> Make each feature work hard to be implemented. Make each feature prove itself and show that it's a survivor. **It's like "Fight Club." You should only consider features if they're willing to stand on the porch for three days waiting to be let in.**

> That's why you start with no. Every new feature request that comes to us – or from us – meets a no. We listen but don't act. **The initial response is "not now."** If a request for a feature keeps coming back, that's when we know it's time to take a deeper look. Then, and only then, do we start considering the feature for real.

> And what do you say to people who complain when you won't adopt their feature idea? Remind them why they like the app in the first place. "You like it because we say no. You like it because it doesn't do 100 other things. You like it because it doesn't try to please everyone all the time."
