# phy documentation

phy is an **electrophysiology data analysis library**. It provides spike sorting and analysis routines for extracellular multielectrode recordings, as well as generic components to build command-line and graphical applications. Overall, phy lets you build custom data analysis applications, for example, a manual clustering GUI.

phy is entirely agnostic to file formats and processing workflows. As such, it can be easily integrated with any existing system.
