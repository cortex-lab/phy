**phy** is an open source neurophysiological data analysis package in Python. It provides features for sorting, analyzing, and visualizing extracellular recordings made with high-density multielectrode arrays containing hundreds to thousands of recording sites.

phy provides format-agnostic APIs to build graphical applications for analysis and visualization of ephys data. There are a few of such applications in [**phycontrib**](http://phy-contrib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
